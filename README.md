# RTL-2-GDSII
Through this program, I am gaining a solid understanding of RISC-V cores, FPGA-based development, hardware description languages (HDL), and various tools for SoC development. The resources include lab exercises, assignments, and project files that demonstrate the application of RISC-V in real-world scenarios.
